# Implementation-of-TF-IDF-Vectorizer
TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.

1. Term Frequency(TF): Number of times each word appears in a document.

2. Inverse Document Frequency(IDF): This can be calculated by taking the total number of documents, dividing it by the number of documents that contain a word, and      calculating the logarithm. At its very core, it says how common or rare a word is in the entire document set. So, if the word is very common and appears in many documents, this number will approach 0. Otherwise, it will approach 1.
